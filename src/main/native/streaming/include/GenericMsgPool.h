/// Memory management framework for EventMsg objects in the
/// "asynchronous event handling" framework.
///
/// MsgType objects are allocated through pool objects, one per
/// listener (that is, there may be several). GenericMsgPool is the
/// generic interface for message allocation and reclamation.
/// Currently the interface is implemented by LocalMsgPool and
/// SharedMemMsgPool. The LocalMsgPool objects keep a stack of free
/// objects, and malloc() new ones when running out of free ones
/// (there is no truncation of free list, at the moment).
/// SharedMemMsgPool is suitable for asynchronous message processing
/// (i.e. when there are separate listener- and message processing
/// threads), which makes message objects returned to the "owner"
/// listener where they are reclaimed using the local message pool.
