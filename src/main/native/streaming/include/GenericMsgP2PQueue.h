/// A thread-safe "point-to-point" (that is, single producer/single
/// consumer) queue. Restricting the queue to single producer and
/// single consumer allows the implementation to avoid using any
/// atomic synchronization instructions - but it still requires
/// write-to-write ordering, specifically that the GenericMsg::next
/// field pointing to another GenericMsg object being added to the queue
/// is update after the new object is completed in memory. Equally,
/// the reading thread's access to that GenericMsg::next field should be
/// a read-acquire operation, i.e. precede all operations on the
/// object pointed by that Event::next pointer.
///
/// The queue is used, in particular, for delivering EventMsg objects
/// from threads receiving ndb update events to threads that aggregate
/// information across multple ndb tables and mediate that aggregated
/// information to upper layers using JNI upcalls. The queue is also
/// used for returning the "spent" objects in the opposite direction
/// (so that EventMsg objects can be "free-listed" by the single
/// thread, without any inter-thread synchronization overhead).
///
/// The producer and consumer threads operate (mostly) using the pair
/// of objects - a "tail" and "head" queue objects, respectively. The
/// tail object allows to enqueue message objects, and the head one
/// allows to dequeue message objects. The tail and head objects are
/// accessed only by the respective threads. The tail and the head of
/// a queue communicate over the GenericMsg::next field of the last
/// GenericMsg object in the queue. Specifically, the tail overwrites
/// the object's NIL pointer with the pointer to a next GenericMsg
/// object, while the head attempts to dequeue an GenericMsg object
/// pointed by the last dequeued object's GenericMsg::next field.
/// When the queue is empty, the tail and the head objects point to
/// the same (already dequeued, and in the case of a new queue -
/// specially allocated) GenericMsg object.
///
/// Since the last dequeued message object is used internally by the
/// queue implementation, GenericMsgP2PQueue relies on the following
/// special discipline controlling reclamation of GenericMsg objects.
/// There are exactly two events that must happen before a message
/// object can be reclaimed: (1) the queue implementation no longer
/// needs the object, and (2) the message handler no longer needs the
/// object. Note that the event (1) occurs upon next successful
/// dequeue() operation (for which there must be a preceding enqueue()
/// operation), and the event (2) may happen quite some after the
/// initial handleMsg() invocation because the latter method is
/// allowed to save the message object for later processing, e.g. when
/// data from multiple messages must be combined. Thus, since the
/// relative order of these two events is generally unknown, the
/// GenericMsg::safeToReclaim() method must be called when either of
/// these events occurs. Upon second call, GenericMsg::safeToReclaim()
/// returns true meaning the object can be reclaimed. Note that both
/// invocations happen in the same thread, therefore
/// GenericMsg::safeToReclaim() does not need to be thread-safe.

/// Only the initP2PQueue<MsgType message P2P queue" object can
/// initialize the head and tail objects.
