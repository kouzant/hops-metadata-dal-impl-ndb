/// GenericMsgHandler is the generic interface to a "message
/// processing service". This allows different implementations:
/// - handling messages in the same "listener" thread (a
///   "single-thread" event processing implementation)
/// - handling messages asynchronously in another thread: instead of
///   handling messages immediately, they are queued and processed by
///   that other thread.
/// - handling messages by a pool of threads: instead of one single
///   queue and corresponding processing thread, there is a number of
///   queues and threads; messages are multiplixed over those using
///   the GenericMsg<>::hashKey() method.
/// Note there can be also multiple listener threads - e.g. processing
/// different input streams - that can do either of the above.
/// 
/// Note that the message handler object is in general stateful.
